## R programming

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ [R boot camp](https://github.com/Another-Goodman/R-boot-camp)

A look at the basics of the R programming language to get you up and running on R. This bootcamp covers the following the installation of R & R Studio, the basics of R and how to read in data and inspect its contents.

### üìù [R markdown](https://github.com/Another-Goodman/R-Markdown-Basics)

A guide to the basics of R markdown and how to upload a project onto Github from R studio.



## Co-occurrence analysis

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è [Co-occurence analysis of AMR genes](https://github.com/Another-Goodman/co-occurrence-analysis)

Co-occurrence analysis of AMR genes highlights the genetic location of AMR genes relative to each other across genomes. Since short read sequencing makes¬†de novo¬†genome assembly difficult at the site of repeated sequences, which cannot be bridged if the reads are shorter than the repeat length, we used co-occurrence analysis to overcome these limitations of short-read sequencing. Co-occurrence analysis allows for the comparison of genetic interactions across genomes. It can show which genes are carried together hinting at carriage on the same or different replicons. We ran a probabilistic analysis of gene co-occurrence to understand the genetic location of AMR genes relative to each other in short-read genomic data.
